/** UIMotionEffect is an abstract superclass which declaratively represents a rendering
    effect that depends on the motion of the device. Given some device pose, subclassers
    provide relative values which are to be applied to the key paths of the target's view.
 
    Subclasses must implement conformance for NSCopying and NSCoding. */

  /** Abstract method. Given the `viewerOffset`, this method should compute a set of key paths
      and relative values pairs which will represent the effect of the device's motion on
      the target view. The return value is a dictionary whose keys and values are these
      key paths (as NSStrings) and relative values, respectively.
  
      The `viewerOffset` is an estimate of the viewer's position relative to direction the
      screen's facing. Values in each dimension range from -1 to 1. Facing straight at the
      viewer is (0, 0). Tilting the phone to the right produces a more positive horizontal
      value; tilting the phone down produces a more positive vertical value.
  
      `keyPaths` should be expressed relative to the effect's target view. Only key paths
      which would animate if set in an animation block may be targeted by motion effects.
  
      Example return value: `@{ @"center": [NSValue 
   valueFromCGPoint:CGPointMake(3.4, 1.2)],
